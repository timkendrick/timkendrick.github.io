## Overview

Bright, enthusiastic hard‑worker with over fifteen years’ experience across multiple industries. I'm highly self-motivated, a fast learner and a committed team member with excellent problem‑solving skills and a keen eye for detail and aesthetics.

Equally comfortable building pixel-perfect UIs, robust frameworks and libraries, or time-saving automation utilities and tooling, I love to tackle big problems and am passionate about developing innovative solutions to formidable technical challenges.

## Frameworks / Technologies

Strong expertise in TypeScript, React, Rust, WASM, Node.js, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, RxJS. I particulary enjoy building polished user interfaces, functional/stream programming, and putting CS theory into practice to solve real-world use cases.

Outside work I take on ambitious solo coding projects and like to learn new concepts from first principles: I've written my own clean-room implementations of programming languages (parsers/interpreters/compilers/macro systems), abstract regular expression engines, actor systems, observables, virtual DOM, etc, to gain a deep understanding of how everyday tools and frameworks are implemented, so that I can make sure to pick the best tool for the job when facing design decisions at work.

## Selected Job Roles and Responsibilities

#### AG Grid (October 2023 - present)

Building developer tools and core features for the market-leading open source datagrid/charts library ([ag-grid.com](https://www.ag-grid.com/)).

#### Marshall Wace (April 2020 - August 2023)

##### Rust Software Engineer (2022 onwards)

Led the design and implementation of an open source reactive programming language (see [promo site](https://timkendrick.co.uk/reflex) for more details). Use on a production system led to codebase size reduction from 15K LOC to 5K. I wrote the compiler/interpreter/devtools in Rust, including both proprietary VM bytecode and WebAssembly back-ends, and accompanying actor-based async server runtime.

##### Lead UI developer (2020 - 2022)

Joined a small, delivery-focused team building the company's flagship internal portfolio management suite and associated component library. Promoted to lead UI dev, where reponsibilities included React UI development, tooling, and DevOps/infra, while revamping our team hiring process to improve the interview:hire ratio from roughly 10:1 to 3:1. Increasing focus on GraphQL API development led to a dedicated role in a team developing streaming technologies for distributed graph systems.

#### 11:FS (March 2019 - December 2019)

Lead TypeScript / React Native developer building a greenfield mobile app UI for a US retail bank's new challenger offering. Responsibilities included front-end architecture design, development of in-house testing framework and cross-platform styling tools, presenting technology-related talks, and interviewing potential new hires. Singlehandedly developed a fully-functioning prototype app within three weeks of arrival, with entire polished V1 release in users' hands within less than three months.

#### Canvas Composer (September 2018 - March 2019)

Solo project building a large-scale IDE for rapid development of React applications ([canvascomposer.com](https://www.canvascomposer.com)). Intuitive UI builder allows toggling between visual drag-and-drop workspace and source code editor. Component library plugins and integrated zero-config build tools and allow rapid application prototyping within a graphical interface. Extensive static JSX source analysis of existing code allows prototypes to be seamlessly integrated within a real codebase.

#### Deutsche Bank / DWS (August 2016 - August 2018)

Lead architect/developer on a graph-based streaming data framework used to power data-driven front-end applications across DWS. Consumer teams reported large productivity gains and vastly decreased bug count. Project responsibilities included product direction, API/architecture design, core library implementation, development of bespoke unit-testing framework and browser plugin for developer tools.

#### Fathom (September 2013 - April 2015)

Lead front‑end developer for a highly interactive real‑time corporate bond trading platform for [Tradeweb](http://tradeweb.com/) and accompanying [component suite](https://www.fathomlondon.com/supergrid). Responsibilities included application architecture, development of in‑house component library, performance tuning/profiling, internal build tools, technical leadership, teaching and supervising other developers, hiring new developers.

#### Burberry (August 2011 - January 2013)

UI development for all interactive experiences on burberry.com, creation of in-house JS/CSS Framework (used across all campaign sites, live streamed fashion shows, press kits and in‑house tools), development of in-house internationalization tools, automation / build process improvements, technical research, hiring and supervising new developers.
