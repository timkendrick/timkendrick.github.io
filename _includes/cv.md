## Overview

Bright, enthusiastic hard‑worker with over fifteen years’ experience across multiple industries. Excellent problem‑solving skills, fast learner, and a keen eye for detail and aesthetics. I'm highly self-motivated and a very strong team member who knows how to design and ship quality products.

Equally comfortable building large-scale UI-driven applications, robust frameworks and libraries, in-house developer tools, compiler/interpreter implementations, or time-saving automation utilities, I love to tackle big problems and take pride in writing clean code built around elegant user-focused APIs.

## Frameworks / Technologies

Strong expertise in Rust, WASM, TypeScript, React, Node, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, RxJS and various other buzzwords. I particulary enjoy functional coding, reactive/stream programming, and anything involving AST transformation/analysis. I like to learn new concepts from first principles, and have written lots of my own libraries for streams, transducers, virtual DOM etc, to gain a deep understanding of how these approaches work at a fine-grained level.

My hobby projects tend to focus on creating a more efficient development experience, often via new programming language paradigms or new takes on existing editor workflows. Recent experiments have focused on WebAssembly, including a macro preprocessor system for the WAT Text Format to simplify hand-coding WASM modules for performance-critical code paths.

## Selected Job Roles and Responsibilities

#### Marshall Wace (April 2020 - present)

Joined as a UI developer on a small, delivery-focused team building the company's flagship internal portfolio management suite (subsequently promoted to lead UI developer). Increasing focus on streaming API development led to a dedicated role developing streaming technologies for distributed systems, primarily leading the design and implementation for a reactive programming language geared towards real-time client/server applications (currently internal, soon to be open-sourced).

The language allows the user to rapidly implement a live-queryable dynamic streaming graph API in a pure-functional subset of JavaScript. All expressions are automatically dependency-tracked for state updates, with results incrementally patched as underlying values change. This enables users to express arbitrarily complex deeply-nested streaming dynamic joins as trivially as plain synchronous expressions. Use on a production system led to codebase size reduction from 15K LOC to 5K LOC.

I wrote the compiler/interpreter/runtime/server/devtools in Rust, using an async actor-based architecture for the server. The language toolchain is highly configurable, with compiler front-ends for multiple interoperable source languages beyond JS, back-end implementations for WASM and a proprietary VM bytecode instruction set, fully extensible standard library etc.

#### 11:FS (March 2019 - December 2019)

Lead TypeScript / React Native developer building a greenfield mobile app for a US retail bank's new challenger offering. Responsibilities included front-end architecture design, development of in-house testing framework and cross-platform styling tools, presenting technology-related talks, and interviewing potential new hires. Singlehandedly developed a fully-functioning prototype app within three weeks of arrival, with entire polished V1 release in users' hands within less than three months.

#### Canvas Composer (September 2018 - March 2019)

Singlehandledly built a large-scale IDE for rapid development of React applications ([canvascomposer.com](https://www.canvascomposer.com)). Intuitive UI builder allows toggling between visual drag-and-drop workspace and source code editor. Component library plugins and integrated zero-config build tools and allow rapid application prototyping within a graphical interface. Extensive static JSX source analysis of existing code allows prototypes to be seamlessly integrated within a real codebase.

#### Deutsche Bank / DWS (August 2016 - August 2018)

Lead architect/developer on a graph-based streaming data framework used to power data-driven front-end applications across DWS. Consumer teams reported large productivity gains and vastly decreased bug count. Project responsibilities included product direction, API/architecture design, core library implementation, development of bespoke unit-testing framework and browser plugin for developer tools.

#### Fathom (September 2013 - April 2015)

Lead front‑end developer for a highly interactive real‑time corporate bond trading platform for [Tradeweb](http://tradeweb.com/) and accompanying [component suite](https://www.fathomlondon.com/supergrid). Responsibilities included application architecture, development of in‑house component library, performance tuning/profiling, internal build tools, technical leadership, teaching and supervising other developers, hiring new developers.

#### Burberry (August 2011 - January 2013)

UI development for all interactive experiences on burberry.com, creation of in-house JS/CSS Framework (used across all campaign sites, live streamed fashion shows, press kits and in‑house tools), development of in-house internationalization tools, automation / build process improvements, technical research, hiring and supervising new developers.
