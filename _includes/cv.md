## Overview

Bright, enthusiastic hard‑worker with over ten years’ experience across multiple industries, working as part of a team and supervising others. Frequent open source contributor with high standards of documentation and testing. Excellent problem‑solving skills, fast learner, and a great eye for detail.

Equally comfortable building large-scale UI-driven applications, real-time streaming data libraries, developer tools, or CLI applications, I love tackling big problems and take pride in front-end application architecture and framework/API design. I'm highly self-motivated and a very strong team member who knows how to ship quality code.

## Frameworks / Technologies

Strong expertise in TypeScript, ES2015+, React, Redux, Node.js, Jest/Mocha/Chai/Jasmine, RxJS/Most, lodash/Underscore, Webpack/Babel, Electron, JSDoc, and various other buzzwords.

I particulary enjoy functional coding, reactive/stream programming, and anything involving AST transformation/analysis. I like to learn new concepts from first principles, so have written lots of my own libraries for streams, transducers, virtual DOM, etc.

## Selected Job Roles and Responsibilities

#### Canvas Composer (September 2018 - present)

Singlehandledly built a large-scale IDE for rapid development of React applications ([canvascomposer.com](https://www.canvascomposer.com), currently in alpha). Intuitive UI builder allows toggling between visual drag-and-drop workspace and source code editor. Component library plugins and integrated zero-config build tools and allow rapid application prototyping within a graphical interface. Extensive static JSX source analysis of existing code allows prototypes to be seamlessly integrated within a real codebase.

Currently packaged as an Electron app written in React/Redux/Node.js, hovever client/server model and highly modular plugin-based architecture allow for easy repurposing to hosted web service.

#### Deutsche Bank / DWS (August 2016 - August 2018)

Lead architect/developer on a graph-based streaming data framework ([Muster](https://dwstech.github.io/muster/), now open-source), used to power data-driven front-end applications across Deutsche Asset Management (now DWS).

Muster is a flexible data language that provides a simple unified interface to coordinate synchronous, asynchronous and streaming data sources. Its virtual graph API combines all an application's data – whether local or remote, synchronous or asynchronous – into a single unified data structure that seamlessly spans client and server, allowing client applications to handle remote data sources as easily as in-app data. Extensive standard library allows smart queries, live mutations, and limitless transformations on real-time data streams (mapping/filtering/combining/etc).

Project responsibilities included product direction, API/architecture design, core library implementation, development of bespoke unit-testing framework and browser plugin for developer tools. Consumers reported large productivity gains and vastly decreased bug count.

#### Filecanvas (September 2015 - April 2016)

Singlehandedly planned, prototyped, designed, built, and shipped a fully-featured SaaS product ([filecanvas.com](https://www.filecanvas.com/)) over the course of six months, in order to better understand the process of creating a product all the way from ideas generation to launch. Sole founder/programmer status meant roles included everything from planning, to coding, to devops, to user testing, to logo design and copywriting.

Technical stack: containerised service-oriented backend architecture (Node.js + Express, nginx + Lua, MongoDB, Redis, Docker Compose), hosted on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, ECR, S3), with extensive Dropbox and Google Drive API integration, vanilla JS front-end with highly interactive virtual-dom template editor, and automated one-line build/deploy via Bash scripts. Combined front-end/back-end codebase is currently around 40,000 lines.


#### Fathom (September 2013 - April 2015)

Lead front‑end developer for a highly interactive real‑time trading platform application and accompanying [component suite](https://www.fathomlondon.com/supergrid). Responsibilities included application architecture, development of in‑house component library, performance tuning/profiling, internal build tools, technical leadership, teaching and supervising other developers, hiring new developers.


#### Burberry (August 2011 - January 2013)

Development of all interactive experiences on burberry.com, creation of in-house JS/CSS Framework (used across all campaign sites, live streamed fashion shows, press kits and in‑house tools), development of in-house internationalization tools, automation / build process improvements, technical research, hiring and supervising new developers.
